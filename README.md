# Deficator

A compound interest calculator for defi yield farming projects which helps you determine how often you should compound your rewards.

This project is forked from [Anura52's work](https://github.com/Anura52/compoundinterestcalc), who provided the original algorithm python script that does the calculation. This is a vue port + frontend designed to run in a browser.

To develop this locally, run `live-server`
